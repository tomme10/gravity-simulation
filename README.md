# Gravity Simulation

a simple step based gravity simulation.

The Simulations's accuracy decreases the larger the time steps.

press < and > to adjust the zoom, use the up and down arrows to adjust time step, and the square brackets to change how many steps are executed a frame

I'll make a better version when I can figure out how to work with differentials
